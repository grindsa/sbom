This repository contains the software bill of materials (SBOM) for some of my projects:

- [acme2certifier](https://github.com/grindsa/acme2certifier) - SBOMs for the containers are being generated during build process by using [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft)
- [dkb-robo](https://github.com/grindsa/dkb-robo) - SBOM gets created during pypi packaging by using [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx-bom-tool.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
